The WeRateDogs data wrangling and analyzing project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree program. 
The main goal of this project was focusing on the data wrangling aspect of doing data analysis. A three-step process of 
gathering data from three different sources, followed by assessing the data, and finally making sure the data was of higher 
quality and tidier than it was when originally downloaded. 

The three different file sources were:
1. Retrieving the WeRateDogs Twitter archive file via download from the link provided within the project instructions
2. Acquiring the tweet image predictions by using the Requests library to access the file on Udacity's servers
3. Using Tweepy to query Twitter's API for data that is not included in the following two files above

Once the data cleaning process was complete, data exploration and data analysis techniques were used to convey
insights including the dog ratings by breed, most popular dog breeds, most popular dog names, and correlations between 
the number of shares a dog gets and the number of likes a dog receives.
